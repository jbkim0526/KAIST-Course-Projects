I checked error case about unique stu num inside student.cpp, non negative stunum in main.cpp & student.cpp
I also checked error case about non negative freshmenclass although it was not written in pdf 
I checked error case for index range only inside student.cpp
I switched the order of the skeleton code but didn't change any interface.


I wasn't sure if I had to print some Information such as "compare result : true" in compare student or find student function so I just did't print anything.

I just named the output program "out" , in the makefile
