I didn't received any help from other students.

-I kept on getting "floating point exception" error when I was working on division and
remainder so I googled on how to use the idivl and found out about "cdq" which fixed the problem.

-I used the last token in this assignment 4.
 I used two at assignment 3 and last one here
